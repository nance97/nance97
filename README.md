## 🚀 About Me  
I'm currently looking to start my master's thesis project to learn more about **multimodal representation learning** and/or **domain adaptation** (estimated start date: February 2026). 
My most recent projects explore how **language–vision models (e.g. CLIP)** can adapt efficiently to new domains and how **autonomous agents** can learn through **self-play and reinforcement learning**.  

I'm especially interested in bridging **research and production environments** — developing models that are both innovative and deployable.

## 🧠 Areas of Interest  
- Multimodal Learning (Vision–Language, Sensor Fusion)  
- Computer Vision & Representation Learning  
- Domain Adaptation & Few-Shot Learning  
- Generative Models (Diffusion, Prompt-based Adaptation)  
- Reinforcement Learning & Autonomous Agents

## 🧩 Featured Projects  

- [**Few-Shot Adaptation of CLIP**](https://github.com/nance97/CLIP_FewShot_Adaptation)  
  _Efficient cross-modal transfer through lightweight alignment of text–image embeddings under domain shift._  
  Explores how multimodal representations can be adapted to new domains using a transport mechanism that bridges text–image latent spaces without full fine-tuning, improving base-class accuracy while preserving zero-shot generalization.

- [**Hive AlphaZero Agent**](https://github.com/DinoCappe/hexa_logic)  
  _An AlphaZero-style reinforcement learning framework for the board game Hive._  
  Implements self-play training from scratch, coupling a convolutional neural network with Monte Carlo Tree Search to autonomously learn optimal strategies from experience, demonstrating scalability of deep RL to complex combinatorial environments.

- [**Terna Chatbot (AI Challenge 2024)**](https://github.com/farihachaiti/Terna-Chatbot)  
  _Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for enterprise document management._  
  Built for Terna S.p.A., the system integrates AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet + Titan V2 embeddings), LangChain, and Streamlit to answer SharePoint-based company queries with grounded, multimodal context retrieved from internal documents.

- [**NLUProject – Language Modeling & Intent–Slot Understanding**](https://github.com/nance97/NLUProject)  
  _Recurrent and transformer-based architectures for natural language understanding._  
  Includes two subprojects: (1) a Penn Treebank language model achieving <90 test perplexity through advanced LSTM regularization (NT-AvSGD, locked dropout, weight tying); and (2) joint intent classification + slot filling on ATIS with BiLSTM and fine-tuned BERT achieving >95% intent accuracy.

- [**SIV – Image Segmentation of Urban Environments**](https://github.com/nance97/SIV)  
  _Comparison between classical and deep learning segmentation approaches on Cityscapes._  
  Implements a region growing algorithm based on color, texture, and gradient cues alongside a U-Net trained for semantic segmentation of 19 urban classes, analyzing trade-offs between unsupervised and supervised pipelines for autonomous driving scenes.
