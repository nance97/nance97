# 👋 Hi, I'm Nancy Kalaj  
🎓 Master's Student in Artificial Intelligence Systems @ University of Trento (Italy)  
💡 Passionate about Computer Vision • Multimodal Learning • Generative AI • Autonomous Systems

## 🚀 About Me  
I'm currently pursuing my master's thesis in **AI and Computer Vision**, with a focus on **multimodal representation learning** and **domain adaptation**.  
My recent projects explore how **language–vision models (e.g. CLIP)** can adapt efficiently to new domains and how **autonomous agents** can learn through **self-play and reinforcement learning**.  

I'm especially interested in bridging **research and production environments** — developing models that are both innovative and deployable.
